If the robot is already in the "home" position with the test code, 
then you can upload the final codes, the code for the Arduino Nano controls the servo motors with the help of the library for the PCA9685 driver, 
the Arduino UNO code controls the gestures performed with the display and the buzzer, 
the arduinos communicate via i2c protocol, the Nano receives the commands from an android application via bluethoot and sends data to the UNO to perform the corresponding gestures
